      "justification": "The research questions are highly multifaceted, spanning technical, ethical, social, economic, psychological, and environmental dimensions of AI and advanced computing. A purely qualitative approach would lack the generalizability and objective measurement needed for system reliability, economic impacts, and environmental footprints. Conversely, a purely quantitative approach would fail to capture the nuanced human experiences, ethical complexities, stakeholder perspectives, and the 'how' behind developing new frameworks and policy interventions. A Mixed-Methods Approach, specifically a Convergent Parallel Design, is recommended because it allows for the comprehensive exploration of both objective phenomena and subjective experiences. It facilitates triangulation of data, enabling a richer, more robust understanding of the problem, validates findings across different data types, and provides a holistic view necessary to address 'how to overcome limitations' and 'develop robust frameworks' for trustworthy AI deployment.",
